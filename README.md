### About
As part of my MySQL DBMS course curriculum, I completed a project to demonstrate database design, database tables, referential integrity, and database functionality. The application developed for this project as follows:
As part of this project, a hypothetical ABC Pharmacy Drug Dispensing and Tracking System was designed. 

The system contains information about the 
* Drug Supplier
* Drug Inventory
* Licensed Pharmacists
* Drugs (prescription, OTC, dietary supplements)
* Patient
* Patient Prescription
* Doctor

At any time, this system can Track the Drug from Drug Supplier to the end Patient, including the Doctor who prescribed, as well as the Pharmacist who provided dispensing services. In case of recalls, side-effects, supply shortage, etc., the tracking system will quickly identify the entire supply chain and alert Patients and Doctors using the contact information provided.
